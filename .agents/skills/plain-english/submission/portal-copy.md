# OpenAI plugin submission

Use this copy for the **Skills only** submission type in the OpenAI plugin submission portal.

## Info

- **Plugin name:** Plain English
- **Category:** Productivity
- **Short description:** Clear prose and unambiguous technical documentation.
- **Long description:** Choose between two complementary writing skills. Plain English audits, rewrites, or minimally edits voice-led prose using Orwell and Gowers' rules plus a second pass for common model-writing habits. Simple English rewrites technical documentation with 53 ASD-STE100-derived rules for short sentences, consistent terminology, simple tenses, condition-first commands, and one instruction per sentence. The plugin routes by content type and never combines the conflicting rule sets.
